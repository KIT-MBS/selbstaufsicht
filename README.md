- masking: combined masking modes
- jigsaw: testing, explore querying only start token, explore jigsawing every individual sequence in the alignment
- train test split: large unlabeled train (~4000), small unlabeled val (~100), small labeled train (~10), large labeled val (~100)
- parameterize tasks
- NAS
- write paper
