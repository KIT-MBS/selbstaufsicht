Self-Supervised Learning for Applications in Bioinformatics.

TODO:
- ~~try focal loss or dice loss~~  (focal loss slightly better than pure cross entropy, dice loss worse)
- ~~implement cross validation akin to coconet~~
- try LBFGS with frozen backbone
- investigate dataset/distribution/generalization issues
- per sequence contrastive
- separate, but weight-shared tasks
- clean up dataset stuff
- downstream optimizer
- hyperparameter
    - SGD ADAM
- ablation study:
    - upstream optimizer
    - backbone complexity
    - downstream depth
    - downstream optimizer
- write paper
- submit paper
