Self-Supervised Learning for Applications in Bioinformatics.

TODO:
- investigate whether embedding should be more complex
- parameterize tasks
- train test split: large unlabeled train (~4000), small unlabeled val (~100), small labeled train (~10), large labeled val (~100)
- NAS
- downstream validation
- separate, but weight-shared tasks
- masking: combined masking modes (optional)
- write paper
- submit paper
