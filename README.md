Self-Supervised Learning for Applications in Bioinformatics.

TODO:
- task loss weights
- run one training into walltime limit
- DROPOUT/REGULARIZATION
- parameterize tasks
- train test split: large unlabeled train (~4000), small unlabeled val (~100), small labeled train (~10), large labeled val (~100)
- NAS
- downstream validation
- separate, but weight-shared tasks
- test utilization of delimiter tokens for classification in the `JigsawHead` as well (optional)
- masking: combined masking modes (optional)
- write paper
- submit paper
